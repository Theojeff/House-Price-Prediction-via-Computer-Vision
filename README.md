 Currently the majority of the machine learning modeling done cannot capture what it means to see a place that you know youâ€™d like to call home, and the model suffers for it. these unquantifiable features that could tune the accuracy of a model by a few percent. For an industry that is at around $30T, and knowing that half the buyers decide by the look, by extracting the images of properties along with other data, i will try to quantify the unquantifiable.

 6+1 method of estimating housing market (model that I created)
 
 Web Scraping by Selenium
 
 Convolutional neural networks explained
 
 house or car (binary)
 
 house or car or neither (categorical)
 
 kitchen or living room or bedroom or bathroom or frontyard (categorical)
 
 low priced or medium priced or high priced
 
 	economic reasoning, zillow report, and previous research
	
 price prediction by images
 
 NEXT: object detection and measuring...
 
 LIMITATIONS: computation power, more images (interior and exterior), tuning ConvNet
